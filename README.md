# My First React Project

This is my first project and experience with React. 

## Things i learn

### `React basics`

*React app life cycle \
*React component state managment \
*JSX 


### `GitHub pages publishing`

*how to make builds \
*how to publish using terminal

## Dificulties in creating this project

### `Component state pushing`

Pushing state through all components, and functions as callback sometimes makes hard to understand what is going on, and im being confused few times when making a big project 

### `First time using FrontEnd framework`

its realy difficult from native JS, but in a good way, i need time to get used to JSX
